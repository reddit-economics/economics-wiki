Career Advice for Undergraduates (by /u/Integralds)

-----

## Coursework

**Math**

* Complete the lower-division sequence in calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations
* Take a yearlong sequence in probability and mathematical statistics
* Take a course in analysis, or preferably a yearlong sequence
* Take additional proof-based courses as you see fit. Topology is a common choice. 
* A final thought. Most people advise you to take math until it hurts. I advise you to take math until it *stops* hurting.

**Economics**

* Take the intermediate core (Intermediate Micro, Intermediate Macro, Econometrics) and do well.
* Take honors versions of intermediate courses if available.
* Take any further course offerings in econometrics. Write a good paper in your econometrics courses.
* Take one course in game theory and one in advanced (dynamic) macroeconomics.

**Computer Science**

* Take the usual first-year sequence in introductory programming and data structures. Consider taking Algorithms.

**Other coursework**

* Learn how to write. 
* Grad schools don't really care about non-math, non-stats, non-econ courses.
* Nevertheless, branch out a little. Take one course each in history, political science, psychology, and sociology. Experience the social sciences from other perspectives.

##Summers

**Intro**

* Your summers are a precious resource. Use them wisely.
* Consider spending one interning in the private sector, one interning in the public sector, and one doing research for a professor.
* Private-sector internships relevant to the Econ PhD include those at AIR, RTI, Westat, MDI, Brookings, Urban, Tax Policy Center, and other research firms. If you are on the fence, try for a finance internship. 
* Public-sector internships are available at the Fed, FDIC, CFPB, Census, BLS, BEA, and CBO.
* Professors who are most likely to need RA's are young assistant profs working on empirical  topics.

**Advice on Internships**

* Whatever you do, get one good internship during college.
* Whatever you do, during that internship, complete your project.
* Most internships consist of putting the intern on a team that's working on some project or another. It is vital that you complete your project, both to impress your employer (and get a full-time offer) and so that you have some accomplishments to put on your resume.
* The typical intern fails at this. Don't be the typical intern.
* Similar advice goes for summer RAships with professors. You should define a straightforward project with deadlines and criteria for success, then accomplish those goals. 
* I strongly advise getting a paid internship over an unpaid one, and doing research with funding than going unfunded.

**Special Advice for Juniors**

* The summer between junior and senior year is especially important.
* Many firms use internships to find good candidates for full-time positions.
* Corollary: if you're going into senior year, and you do an awesome job at your internship, you have a decent likelihood of converting your internship into a job.
* Implication: work especially hard to secure a good internship in your junior summer, and work especially hard at that internship.

##Research

**Summer RAs, again**

* Complete one summer research assistantship with a professor. Try to get your name on a paper, probably as RA, but more ambitiously as co-author. (Co-author rarely happens. You will probably settle for "we thank iaglia for excellent research assistance...")
* *Complete* the summer RAship. What that means varies by project, but you'll know it when you see it. 
* I can't stress enough how many people take on projects, leave them half-finished, then are surprised when the professor can't write them a strong letter of recommendation.

**Senior Thesis**

* If you're serious about getting a PhD, it's useful to write a senior thesis to get a taste of independent research.
* Start this thesis the summer before your senior year, then use the fall semester to write a solid draft.
* One trick is to use your junior summer RAship (which you've gotten if you've followed along this far) to jump-start your thesis.

## Letters of Recommendation

* You need 3 LORs
* All three should come from academic economists
* At most one may, if you wish, come from a math professor
* These LORs should speak to your math ability (that is, ability to survive the core) and your research aptitude (that is, your ability to successfully complete a dissertation)
* Only academic economists are in a position to judge your research aptitude.
* Your senior thesis advisor should be one of your LOR writers.
* The others could be people you RA'd for or people from whom you took a few substantive upper-level econ courses.
* If you interned at the Fed, you may obtain one letter from an academic economist (preferably your internship advisor) at the Fed.

## Other stuff

**Teaching**

* Poke around and ask profs if they need TAs. Your best bets are intro courses and econ stats courses.
* TA work won't help you get into grad school but it's nice to have the experience.
* Also it pays.

**Extracurriculars**

* Grad schools don't care that you were captain of the debate team. Take math instead.

**After undergrad**

* Consider undertaking a two-year RAship at the Fed. Everyone who does loves it and they tend to get into better grad schools because of the experience.
* Jobs that aren't at a central bank basically don't count for grad admissions.

##Applying

**Grad schools care about:**

* GRE scores (try to get a perfect math score, 5.0+ AWA, and non-atrocious verbal score)
* Math coursework and grades
* Econ coursework and grades
* Overall GPA (think 3.7+)
* Letters of recommendation, which should come from academic economists
* Research experience
* Teaching experience (at some schools, e.g. Cornell)
* Writing sample (sort of; see NYU's FAQ for warnings and cautions)
* Statement of Purpose (not really; it apparently matters much less in econ than in other fields)

## Final thoughts

If you follow this advice, you'll have

* Two internships
* A summer RAship
* A boatload of math, stats, econ, and CS
* Great written and spoken presentation skills
* A senior thesis
* A year or two of TA experience

That's not a bad resume, even if you end up not going to grad school.
