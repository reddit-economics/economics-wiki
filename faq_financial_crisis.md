**The Financial crisis of 2008**

The purpose of this FAQ section is to talk about the causes of the financial crisis which occurred in 2008. The financial crisis caused [a deep recession in the United States and Europe](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/Blog/2017/February/BlogImage_RealGDPGrowth_022717.jpg?la=en), saw growth slow across the world, and was inexorably linked to the beginning of the long-running crisis in the Eurozone.

There were long-term regulatory responses to the crisis which involved, in the United States, major legislation such as Dodd-Frank, in China, reforms of the shadow banking sector, and in Europe, new thinking about banking unions to say nothing of the reform efforts made in other countries. Additionally, there were short-run “firefighting” measures undertaken by both governments and central banks. In the United States, the Federal Reserve [employed a veritable alphabet soup of lending programmes](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fed_credit_programs) to inject liquidity into the markets and the US Congress used the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP) to help repair bank balance sheets. Additionally, governments around the world reacted with stimulus packages of varying magnitudes and many central banks also engaged in "quantitative easing."

The reader will find **no discussion** of the government & central bank response to the crisis in this write-up. The purpose of this FAQ section is to attempt to answer the question "how we got there" and "what it was" with regards to the financial crisis.

**Section 1: The supershort version**

Alan Blinder, a prominent American economist and a former member of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), had an excellent paragraph that summed up the crisis neatly in his book [After the Music Stopped]( https://www.amazon.com/After-Music-Stopped-Financial-Response/dp/014312448X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1488175309&sr=1-2&keywords=when+the+music+stopped):

>Some people think of the financial markets as a kind of glorified casino with little relevance to the real economy—where the jobs, factories, and shops are. But that’s wrong. Finance is more like the circulatory system of the economic body. And if the blood stops flowing . . . well, you don’t want to think about it. All modern economies rely on a variety of credit-granting mechanisms to circulate nutrients to the rest of the system, and the U.S. economy is more credit-dependent and “financialised” than most. 

>So when the once-copious flows of credit diminished to mere trickles, the economy nearly experienced cardiac arrest. What had been far too much liquidity and credit during the boom years quickly turned into vastly too little. The abrupt drying-up of credit, from both banks and the so-called shadow banking system, coupled with the massive destruction of wealth in the forms of houses, stocks, and securities, produced what you might expect: less credit, less buying, and a whopping recession.

The above excerpt is instructive in understanding, in a nutshell, what the financial crisis was all about.

**Section 2: Weaknesses in the financial system**

The financial crisis did not have one cause. A myriad of events and causes interacted to create a perfect-storm. In the same book quoted above, Blinder identified seven "key weaknesses" of the US financial system:


>1.	inflated asset prices, especially of houses (the housing bubble) but also of certain securities (the bond bubble);
2.	excessive leverage (heavy borrowing) throughout the financial system and the economy;
3.	lax financial regulation, both in terms of what the law left unregulated and how poorly the various regulators performed their duties;
4.	disgraceful banking practices in subprime and other mortgage lending;
5.	the crazy-quilt of unregulated securities and derivatives that were built on these bad mortgages;
6.	the abysmal performance of the statistical rating agencies, which helped the crazy-quilt get stitched together; and
7.	the perverse compensation systems in many financial institutions that created powerful incentives to go for broke.

These seven asepcts are not "equal" and indeed, it is hard to quantify which ones "mattered" more. The financial crisis and its many facets will continue to be important research topics in the field of economics for some time to come. I will summarise each one of these in turn with links to sources where appropriate.

**Section 2-1: The Asset bubble**

By this point, everyone has heard about the housing bubble. [This graph](http://imgur.com/a/FHpif), which charts real house prices in the United States from 1890-2012 reveals that the relative price of housing in the United States was quite stable from the years 1890-1997 displaying an average annual increase of just 0.09 of 1 percentage point. However, that changed in the early 2000's. Between 1997-2006, the index soared by 85% before crashing.

However, it was not obvious in real-time that there was a housing bubble. Mortgage interest rates were coming down and the economy was strong. As late as October 2005, Ben Bernanke, who was then Chairman of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers and who went on to become the chairman of the Federal Reserve, declared that while “house prices have risen by nearly 25 percent over the past two years . . . these price increases largely reflect strong economic fundamentals.”

The causes of the housing bubble are a topic in and of themselves and I do not have the remit to address the full story here. I would like to point readers to the following sources for further reading:

- [Housing Bubbles](http://real.wharton.upenn.edu/~duranton/Duranton_Papers/Handbook/Housing_bubbles.pdf) by Ed Gleaser. This paper goes over several stylised facts of housing bubbles and covers several explanations of why "rational" bubbles can arise (hint: underpriced risk)

- [Loan Originations and Defaults in the Mortgage Crisis: The Role of the Middle Class](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/economics/pdf/Seminars/SemF2015/A2S_LoanOrigDefault2015_v3.pdf) by Adelino et al. This study analyses the claim that the housing bubble was driven primarily by reckless lending to the poor and finds holes in that theory. Middle and high-income households made up the majority of loan originations even at the peak of the boom and people from all income brackets "bought into the idea of ever increasing house values."

I strongly recommend readers to read those sources if they want to understand the housing bubble.

There was another, related bubble which also burst in 2007: the asset bubble. Glaeser alludes to this in the paper above when he says that for "rational bubbles" to form, default risk has to be underpriced. This was indeed the case for the myriad of housing related securities which also collapsed in value during the crises. These securities included, but were not limited to, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) and collateralised debt swaps (CDS). The collapse in these securities took down many financial institutions including, but not limited to, AIG, Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns. All of these securities will be discussed in **Section 2-5.** However, at this juncture, I do want to introduce an idea as to why such securities rose up in the first place. Here, I point readers to the idea of a "global savings glut" and the "safe asset-shortage". I recommend readers to read through the sources below:

- [The Global Savings glut speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/) by Ben Bernanke which argued that excess global savings (in countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, etc) resulted in low long-term interest rates in the United States which fueled the asset bubble. 

- This idea is also linked to the notion that the world, in the early 2000's, was [experiencing a "safe-asset shortage"](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15636) and that the United States, with its deep and sophisticated financial markets, was in a unique position to supply these assets. Thus, as the result of a desire to satisfy this shortage, the financial sector came up with several "AAA-rated securities" that seemed as safe as Treasuries, but, turned out not to be. [A summary of the Caballero paper can be found here](http://voxeu.org/article/new-insight-role-imbalances-global-crisis) and I would also like to point readers to a [Bank of International Settlements paper on global imbalances.](http://www.bis.org/publ/work346.pdf)

I strongly recommend readers to read those sources if they want to understand the asset bubble.

**Section 2-2: Excessive leverage**

First, we must define the idea of leverage. Leverage refers to the use of borrowed funds to purchase assets. The word itself derives from Archimedes, who famously declared that he could move the Earth with a large enough lever. The important point for present purposes is that leverage magnifies both gains on the way up and losses on the way down. Consider a simple example:

- Person A buys a $1 million worth of bonds with a 6% coupon entirely with their own money and gets a 6% coupon payment after a year

- Person B also buys the same $1 million worth of bonds but also borrows an additional $9 million at 3% per year to buy more of the same bonds. 

Person A got a straight 6% return on their investment at the end of the year, but, person B would have gotten approximately 33%. Does this mean Person B is smarter than Person A? 

Not necessarily. Suppose instead of a return of 6% at the end of the year, the bond falls in value by 5%. Person A would simply lose the 5%, but get the 6% coupon payment and still be "up" by 1%.
Person B, who also has to pay the bank, would lose approximately 17%: 10m-0.5m+0.6m (coupon)-9.27m (bank repayment)=0.83m of the original 1m.

Leverage is not automatically "bad." Without the idea of leverage, we would have no mortgages, no car loans, no student loans and very little credit. However, with leverage comes risk and some financial institutions were very highly levered at the beginning of the crisis such that even a small loss on their assets was enough to wipe them out.

During the boom, too many leading banks employed legal and accounting gimmicks to push their leverage higher. One way they did so was by creating off-balance-sheet entities such as structured investment vehicles (SIVs) which had laxer capital requirements. These vehicles had eye-popping leverage ratios such that small losses would render these vehicles bankrupt at which point they would have to run back to their parent institutions.

Firms like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs (the old Big Five) operated with 30-to-1 or even 40-to-1 leverage. Think about what that means: With 40-to-1 leverage, a mere 2.5 percent decline in the value of your assets wipes out all shareholder value. The banks were able to do this via creative accounting through which they skirted capital requirements.

However, another aspect of the excessive leverage that sometimes gets overlooked is that much of the lending was very short-term, often overnight. For example, Bear Stearns’ year-end 2006 balance sheet listed only 16 percent of its liabilities as long-term borrowings. Its short-term borrowings were more than eight times its equity. [Its reported leverage ratio in 2007 was was 36 to 1.](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/FINANCIALSECTOR/Resources/02BearStearnsCaseStudy.pdf) This meant that as soon as markets got an inkling that a firm like Bear "couldn't pay" overnight credit dried up instantly and the institution went under. 

This is a large topic which I am only able to superficially address in this space. I would like to point readers to some of the literature around "leverage cycles," specifically, this paper titled [Credit Booms Gone Bust: Monetary Policy, Leverage Cycles and Financial Crises, 1870-2008](http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/schularick_taylor.pdf) by Schularick & Taylor which examines the link between credit growth and financial crises as well as the idea of leverage cycles.

**Section 2-3: Lax regulation**

A lot of people have, not without merit, blamed the financial crises on inadequate regulation. Blinder, in the book linked in **Section 1** writes:

>Under the Fed’s unwatchful eye, banks proliferated the SIVs we met in the previous chapter. They granted hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of embarrassingly bad subprime mortgages, many of them designed to default (more on this shortly). And they invested huge sums in risky assets that they portrayed as, and maybe even believed were, safe. Each of these disgraceful banking practices was, as they say, hidden in plain sight. Incurious regulators just didn’t look.

>Though frequently done, it is wrong to blame the regulatory breakdown entirely on the Federal Reserve. In truth, while the Fed was the most prominent of the nation’s four bank regulators, it was not the biggest player. Most bankers dealt much more with regulatory personnel from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the now-abolished Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the FDIC. And each was just as asleep at the wheel as the Fed—although Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the FDIC, put the others to shame with her prompt recognition of the impending tsunami of foreclosures. One of the great tragedies of the financial crisis is that bank regulators could have slammed the door on some of the more outrageous underwriting practices but didn’t.

[Bernanke notes in Chapter 5 of his book](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Act-Memoir-Crisis-Aftermath/dp/0393353990/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) that the Federal Reserve was not really responsible for regulating a lot of these entities. The lack of good oversight was the result of a muddle of regulatory agencies created by the Congress’ ad-hoc approach to regulation:

>The result was a muddle. For example, regulation of financial markets (such as the stock market and futures markets) is split between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an agency created by Congress in 1974. The regulation of banks is dictated by the charter under which each bank operates. While banks chartered at the federal level, so-called national banks, are regulated by the OCC, banks chartered by state authorities are overseen by state regulators. State-chartered banks that choose to be members of the Federal Reserve System (called state member banks) are also supervised by the Federal Reserve, with the FDIC examining other state-chartered banks. And the Fed oversees bank holding companies—companies that own banks and possibly other types of financial firms—independent of whether the owned banks are state-chartered or nationally chartered. Before the crisis, still another agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), regulated savings institutions and the companies that owned savings associations. And the National Credit Union Association oversees credit unions.

>Institutions were able to change regulators by changing their charters, which created an incentive for regulators to be less strict so as not to lose their regulatory “clients”—and the exam fees they paid. For example, in March 2007, the subprime lender Countrywide Financial, by switching the charter of the depository institution it owned, replaced the Fed as its principal supervisor with the OTS, after the OTS promised to be “less antagonistic.”

Bernanke notes that only 20% of Sub-prime loans in 2005 were issued by institutions under Federal supervision. The rest were made by non-bank subsidiaries, independent non-depository lending firms and a host of other entities under state supervision, which tended to be abysmal. The one thing you can criticise the Fed for is perhaps not fully utilising its broad-based power under HOEPA (The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act) to ban “unfair or deceptive” lending practices which would apply to all lenders.

The Fed did infact use these powers after the problems with the subprime markets were fully realised, but it was too late by then. The justification given by Bernanke with regards to the failure to use HOEPA powers more aggressively earlier on is:

 >Why the support for subprime lending? Historically, lenders had often denied low-income and minority borrowers access to credit. Some lenders redlined whole neighborhoods, automatically turning down mortgage applications from anyone who lived in them…Subprime lending was widely seen as the antidote to redlining—and thus a key part of the democratization of credit. It helped push the U.S. homeownership rate to a record 69 percent by 2005, up from 64 percent a decade earlier. Many of the new homeowners were African Americans and Hispanics, and people with low incomes.

In other words, the Fed tolerated subprime lending because of a genuine belief that subprime credit could help borrowers with poor credit ratings achieve a key part of the “American Dream,” homeownership. In hindsight, its tolerance of many of those practices was a mistake.

Financial regulation is, like the other topics, a complex affair which I am unable to discuss in greater detail given space limitations. I point readers to the following sources:

- [Why didn't Canada have a banking crisis in 2008 (or in 1930, or 1907, or ...)?](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17312) by Bordo et al. This descriptive study compares and contrasts the regulatory regime of the United States with that of Canada and argues that the Canadian system, with one powerful overarching regulator, is superior to the US system of "weak, fragmented, overlapping and competing regulatory authorities." Beyond that, it is also a good historical overview of the development of the US financial system. The Richmond Fed [acknowledged Bordo's work in a comment here.](https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2013/q4/pdf/feature2.pdf)

- A while ago, [I wrote up a long post on /r/badeconomics regarding Glass-Steagall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/5nx2mm/glassstegall_would_have_saved_us/) in which I argue that the existence Glass-Steagall would have made a difference in the financial crisis.
