**The Financial crisis of 2008**

The purpose of this FAQ section is to talk about the causes of the financial crisis which occurred in 2008. The financial crisis caused [a deep recession in the United States and Europe](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/Blog/2017/February/BlogImage_RealGDPGrowth_022717.jpg?la=en), saw growth slow across the world, and was inexorably linked to the beginning of the long-running crisis in the Eurozone.

There were long-term regulatory responses to the crisis which involved; in the United States, major legislation such as Dodd-Frank; in China, reforms of the shadow banking sector; and in Europe, new thinking about banking unions (to say nothing of the reform efforts made in other countries). Additionally, there were short-run “firefighting” measures undertaken by both governments and central banks. In the United States, the Federal Reserve [employed a veritable alphabet soup of lending programmes](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fed_credit_programs) to inject liquidity into the markets and the US Congress used the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP) to help repair bank balance sheets. Additionally, governments around the world reacted with stimulus packages of varying magnitudes and many central banks also engaged in "quantitative easing."

The reader will find **no discussion** of the government & central bank response to the crisis in this write-up. The purpose of this FAQ section is to attempt to answer the question "how we got there" and "what it was" with regards to the financial crisis.

**Section 1: The supershort version**

Alan Blinder, a prominent American economist and a former member of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), had an excellent paragraph that summed up the crisis neatly in his book [After the Music Stopped]( https://www.amazon.com/After-Music-Stopped-Financial-Response/dp/014312448X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1488175309&sr=1-2&keywords=when+the+music+stopped):

>*Some people think of the financial markets as a kind of glorified casino with little relevance to the real economy—where the jobs, factories, and shops are. But that’s wrong. Finance is more like the circulatory system of the economic body. And if the blood stops flowing . . . well, you don’t want to think about it. All modern economies rely on a variety of credit-granting mechanisms to circulate nutrients to the rest of the system, and the U.S. economy is more credit-dependent and “financialised” than most.* 

>*So when the once-copious flows of credit diminished to mere trickles, the economy nearly experienced cardiac arrest. What had been far too much liquidity and credit during the boom years quickly turned into vastly too little. The abrupt drying-up of credit, from both banks and the so-called shadow banking system, coupled with the massive destruction of wealth in the forms of houses, stocks, and securities, produced what you might expect: less credit, less buying, and a whopping recession.*

The above excerpt is instructive in understanding, in a nutshell, what the financial crisis was all about.

**Section 2: Weaknesses in the financial system**

The financial crisis did not have one cause. A myriad of events and causes interacted to create a perfect-storm. In the same book quoted above, Blinder identified seven "key weaknesses" of the US financial system:


>1.	inflated asset prices, especially of houses (the housing bubble) but also of certain securities (the bond bubble);
2.	excessive leverage (heavy borrowing) throughout the financial system and the economy;
3.	lax financial regulation, both in terms of what the law left unregulated and how poorly the various regulators performed their duties;
4.	disgraceful banking practices in subprime and other mortgage lending;
5.	the crazy-quilt of unregulated securities and derivatives that were built on these bad mortgages;
6.	the abysmal performance of the statistical rating agencies, which helped the crazy-quilt get stitched together; and
7.	the perverse compensation systems in many financial institutions that created powerful incentives to go for broke.

These seven aspects are not "equal" and indeed, it is hard to quantify which ones "mattered" more. The financial crisis and its many facets will continue to be important research topics in the field of economics for some time to come. I will summarise each one of these in turn with links to sources where appropriate.

**Section 2-1: The Asset bubble**

By this point, everyone has heard about the housing bubble. [This graph](http://imgur.com/a/FHpif), which charts real house prices in the United States from 1890-2012 reveals that the relative price of housing in the United States was quite stable from the years 1890-1997 displaying an average annual increase of just 0.09 of 1 percentage point. However, that changed in the early 2000's. Between 1997-2006, the index soared by 85% before crashing.

However, it was not obvious in real-time that there was a housing bubble. Mortgage interest rates were coming down and the economy was strong. As late as October 2005, Ben Bernanke, who was then Chairman of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers and who went on to become the chairman of the Federal Reserve, declared that while “house prices have risen by nearly 25 percent over the past two years . . . these price increases largely reflect strong economic fundamentals.”

The causes of the housing bubble are a topic in and of themselves and I do not have the remit to address the full story here. I would like to point readers to the following sources for further reading:

- [Housing Bubbles](http://real.wharton.upenn.edu/~duranton/Duranton_Papers/Handbook/Housing_bubbles.pdf) by Ed Gleaser. This paper goes over several stylised facts of housing bubbles and covers several explanations of why "rational" bubbles can arise (hint: underpriced risk)

- [Loan Originations and Defaults in the Mortgage Crisis: The Role of the Middle Class](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/economics/pdf/Seminars/SemF2015/A2S_LoanOrigDefault2015_v3.pdf) by Adelino et al. This study analyses the claim that the housing bubble was driven primarily by reckless lending to the poor and finds holes in that theory. Middle and high-income households made up the majority of loan originations even at the peak of the boom and people from all income brackets "bought into the idea of ever increasing house values."

I strongly recommend readers to read those sources if they want to understand the housing bubble.

There was another, related bubble which also burst in 2007: the asset bubble. Glaeser alludes to this in the paper above when he says that for "rational bubbles" to form, default risk has to be underpriced. This was indeed the case for the myriad of housing related securities which also collapsed in value during the crises. These securities included, but were not limited to, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) and collateralised debt swaps (CDS). The collapse in these securities took down many financial institutions including, but not limited to, AIG, Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns. All of these securities will be discussed in **Section 2-5.** However, at this juncture, I do want to introduce an idea as to why such securities rose up in the first place. Here, I point readers to the idea of a "global savings glut" and the "safe asset-shortage". I recommend readers to read through the sources below:

- [The Global Savings glut speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/) by Ben Bernanke which argued that excess global savings (in countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, etc) resulted in low long-term interest rates in the United States which fueled the asset bubble. 

- This idea is also linked to the notion that the world, in the early 2000's, was [experiencing a "safe-asset shortage"](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15636) and that the United States, with its deep and sophisticated financial markets, was in a unique position to supply these assets. Thus, as the result of a desire to satisfy this shortage, the financial sector came up with several "AAA-rated securities" that seemed as safe as Treasuries, but, turned out not to be. [A summary of the Caballero paper can be found here](http://voxeu.org/article/new-insight-role-imbalances-global-crisis) and I would also like to point readers to a [Bank of International Settlements paper on global imbalances.](http://www.bis.org/publ/work346.pdf)

I strongly recommend readers to read those sources if they want to understand the asset bubble.

**Section 2-2: Excessive leverage**

First, we must define the idea of leverage. Leverage refers to the use of borrowed funds to purchase assets. The word itself derives from Archimedes, who famously declared that he could move the Earth with a large enough lever. The important point for present purposes is that leverage magnifies both gains on the way up and losses on the way down. Consider a simple example:

- Person A buys a $1 million worth of bonds with a 6% coupon entirely with their own money and gets a 6% coupon payment after a year

- Person B also buys the same $1 million worth of bonds but also borrows an additional $9 million at 3% per year to buy more of the same bonds. 

Person A got a straight 6% return on their investment at the end of the year, but, person B would have gotten approximately 33%. Does this mean Person B is smarter than Person A? 

Not necessarily. Suppose instead of a return of 6% at the end of the year, the bond falls in value by 5%. Person A would simply lose the 5%, but get the 6% coupon payment and still be "up" by 1%.
Person B, who also has to pay the bank, would lose approximately 17%: 10m-0.5m+0.6m (coupon)-9.27m (bank repayment)=0.83m of the original 1m.

Leverage is not automatically "bad." Without the idea of leverage, we would have no mortgages, no car loans, no student loans and very little credit. However, with leverage comes risk and some financial institutions were very highly levered at the beginning of the crisis such that even a small loss on their assets was enough to wipe them out.

During the boom, too many leading banks employed legal and accounting gimmicks to push their leverage higher. One way they did so was by creating off-balance-sheet entities such as structured investment vehicles (SIVs) which had laxer capital requirements. These vehicles had eye-popping leverage ratios such that small losses would render these vehicles bankrupt at which point they would have to run back to their parent institutions.

Firms like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs (the old Big Five) operated with 30-to-1 or even 40-to-1 leverage. Think about what that means: With 40-to-1 leverage, a mere 2.5 percent decline in the value of your assets wipes out all shareholder value. The banks were able to do this via creative accounting through which they skirted capital requirements.

However, another aspect of the excessive leverage that sometimes gets overlooked is that much of the lending was very short-term, often overnight. For example, Bear Stearns’ year-end 2006 balance sheet listed only 16 percent of its liabilities as long-term borrowings. Its short-term borrowings were more than eight times its equity. [Its reported leverage ratio in 2007 was was 36 to 1.](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/FINANCIALSECTOR/Resources/02BearStearnsCaseStudy.pdf) This meant that as soon as markets got an inkling that a firm like Bear "couldn't pay" overnight credit dried up instantly and the institution went under. 

This is a large topic which I am only able to superficially address in this space. I would like to point readers to some of the literature around "leverage cycles," specifically, this paper titled [Credit Booms Gone Bust: Monetary Policy, Leverage Cycles and Financial Crises, 1870-2008](http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/schularick_taylor.pdf) by Schularick & Taylor which examines the link between credit growth and financial crises as well as the idea of leverage cycles.

**Section 2-3: Lax regulation**

A lot of people have, not without merit, blamed the financial crises on inadequate regulation. Blinder, in the book linked in **Section 1** writes:

>Under the Fed’s unwatchful eye, banks proliferated the SIVs we met in the previous chapter. They granted hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of embarrassingly bad subprime mortgages, many of them designed to default (more on this shortly). And they invested huge sums in risky assets that they portrayed as, and maybe even believed were, safe. Each of these disgraceful banking practices was, as they say, hidden in plain sight. Incurious regulators just didn’t look.

>*Though frequently done, it is wrong to blame the regulatory breakdown entirely on the Federal Reserve. In truth, while the Fed was the most prominent of the nation’s four bank regulators, it was not the biggest player. Most bankers dealt much more with regulatory personnel from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the now-abolished Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the FDIC. And each was just as asleep at the wheel as the Fed—although Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the FDIC, put the others to shame with her prompt recognition of the impending tsunami of foreclosures. One of the great tragedies of the financial crisis is that bank regulators could have slammed the door on some of the more outrageous underwriting practices but didn’t.*

[Bernanke notes in Chapter 5 of his book](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Act-Memoir-Crisis-Aftermath/dp/0393353990/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) that the Federal Reserve was not really responsible for regulating a lot of these entities. The lack of good oversight was the result of a muddle of regulatory agencies created by the Congress’ ad-hoc approach to regulation:

>*The result was a muddle. For example, regulation of financial markets (such as the stock market and futures markets) is split between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an agency created by Congress in 1974. The regulation of banks is dictated by the charter under which each bank operates. While banks chartered at the federal level, so-called national banks, are regulated by the OCC, banks chartered by state authorities are overseen by state regulators. State-chartered banks that choose to be members of the Federal Reserve System (called state member banks) are also supervised by the Federal Reserve, with the FDIC examining other state-chartered banks. And the Fed oversees bank holding companies—companies that own banks and possibly other types of financial firms—independent of whether the owned banks are state-chartered or nationally chartered. Before the crisis, still another agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), regulated savings institutions and the companies that owned savings associations. And the National Credit Union Association oversees credit unions.*

>*Institutions were able to change regulators by changing their charters, which created an incentive for regulators to be less strict so as not to lose their regulatory “clients”—and the exam fees they paid. For example, in March 2007, the subprime lender Countrywide Financial, by switching the charter of the depository institution it owned, replaced the Fed as its principal supervisor with the OTS, after the OTS promised to be “less antagonistic.”*

Bernanke notes that only 20% of Sub-prime loans in 2005 were issued by institutions under Federal supervision. The rest were made by non-bank subsidiaries, independent non-depository lending firms and a host of other entities under state supervision, which tended to be abysmal. The one thing you can criticise the Fed for is perhaps not fully utilising its broad-based power under HOEPA (The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act) to ban “unfair or deceptive” lending practices which would apply to all lenders.

The Fed did infact use these powers after the problems with the subprime markets were fully realised, but it was too late by then. The justification given by Bernanke with regards to the failure to use HOEPA powers more aggressively earlier on is:

 >*Why the support for subprime lending? Historically, lenders had often denied low-income and minority borrowers access to credit. Some lenders redlined whole neighborhoods, automatically turning down mortgage applications from anyone who lived in them…Subprime lending was widely seen as the antidote to redlining—and thus a key part of the democratization of credit. It helped push the U.S. homeownership rate to a record 69 percent by 2005, up from 64 percent a decade earlier. Many of the new homeowners were African Americans and Hispanics, and people with low incomes.*

In other words, the Fed tolerated subprime lending because of a genuine belief that subprime credit could help borrowers with poor credit ratings achieve a key part of the “American Dream,” homeownership. In hindsight, its tolerance of many of those practices was a mistake.

Financial regulation is, like the other topics, a complex affair which I am unable to discuss in greater detail given space limitations. I point readers to the following sources:

- [Why didn't Canada have a banking crisis in 2008 (or in 1930, or 1907, or ...)?](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17312) by Bordo et al. This descriptive study compares and contrasts the regulatory regime of the United States with that of Canada and argues that the Canadian system, with one powerful overarching regulator, is superior to the US system of "weak, fragmented, overlapping and competing regulatory authorities." Beyond that, it is also a good historical overview of the development of the US financial system. The Richmond Fed [acknowledged Bordo's work in a comment here.](https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2013/q4/pdf/feature2.pdf)

- A while ago, [I wrote up a long post on /r/badeconomics regarding Glass-Steagall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/5nx2mm/glassstegall_would_have_saved_us/) in which I argue that the existence Glass-Steagall would have made a difference in the financial crisis.

**Section 2-4: Practices in mortgage lending, securitisation and shadow banking**

The previous section hinted at improprieties in the US mortgage markets. This section will contain more detailed descriptions of how the US mortgage market was structured and the process of securitisation. 

The first thing to note is that over time, the US mortgage business changed dramatically. Traditionally, mortgages would be issued to local residents by banks which wished to hold on to the mortgage as an asset on their books and thus, had an incentive to make sure that the borrowing party had the capacity to pay. This simple model began to shift gradually towards a model whereby banks would make the loan, and immediately, or soon afterwards, sell the loan to a securitiser. This became known as the "originate-to-distribute" model. From [Alan Blinder](https://www.amazon.com/After-Music-Stopped-Financial-Response/dp/014312448X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1488175309&sr=1-2&keywords=when+the+music+stopped):

> *"A large and growing share of the worst subprime mortgages were not issued by banks at all, but rather by nonbank lenders who would originate dodgy mortgages, perhaps hold them for only a matter of days, and then sell them off to securitizers (whom we will meet shortly). For example, only one of the top ten subprime mortgage originators in 2005 was a regulated commercial bank (Wells Fargo). By 2007 more than half of all subprime loans were being originated by mortgage brokers rather than by banks. Indeed, (Ned) Gramlich estimated that only 20 percent of subprime loans granted in 2005 came from regularly supervised banks and thrifts."*

> *"The nonbank lenders operated beyond the purview of the federal regulatory system, which often meant that they operated with no adult supervision at all. (The severity of the problem varied state by state.) That said, federal regulators should have seen more than enough shenanigans to make them sit up and take notice. But they didn’t."*

After these loans were sold, the entities which bought them issued assets such as CDOs, MBSs, etc (more on this later). All of these firms (or the parts of banks that engaged in these activities) were part of the so-called "shadow banking system."  [An Economist magazine special report issued in May 2014](http://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20140510_international_banking.pdf) had the following to say on the topic:

>*THE DEFINITION OF shadow banking is itself shadowy . The term was coined in 2007 by Paul McCulley, a senior executive at PIMCO , a big asset manager, to describe the legal structures used by big Western banks before the financial crisis to keep opaque and complicated securitised loans o ff their balance- sheets, but it is now generally used much more broadly. The Financial Stability Board, an international watchdog set up to guard against financial crises, defines shadow banking as “credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system”—in other words, lending by anything other than a bank.*

The report goes on to provide a succinct accounting of the events which transpired:

>*Shadow banking got itself a bad name during the financial crisis , chiefly in the form of off-balance-sheet vehicles that were notionally separate from banks but in practice dependent on them. Their assets were often securitised loans that turned out to be much riskier and less valuable than expected. These vehicles were meant to expand credit , and thus bolster the economy , while spreading the risks involved; at least that was the justification for excluding them from the banks’ liabilities and allowing them to hold relatively little capital to protect against potential losses. Yet when they got into trouble , the banks had to bail them out on such a scale that many of the banks themselves then needed bailing out. The vehicles turned out to be an accounting gimmick dressed up as a service to society.*

Before I go on, it is necessary to explain to the reader what the acronyms MBS, CDOs, CDSs mean and what a derivative is in general. “Derivative” is a generic term for any security or contract whose value is derived from that of some underlying natural security, such as a stock or a bond. Instead of owning the asset, and either profiting or losing as its price rises or falls, a derivative is a bet on some aspect of its behavior. Derivatives have a myriad of legitimate uses. They are used by airlines to hedge fuel costs ([sometimes to hilariously disastrous consequences](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-15/cathay-profit-margin-under-pressure-as-fuel-hedging-losses-mount)), by businesses to hedge currency risk, by institutional investors (pension funds, etc) to hedge interest rate risk, etc. For example, Anheuser-Busch, uses exchange-traded wheat futures and over-the-counter aluminum swaps to hedge the risk of higher wheat and aluminum prices eroding profitability.

However, in the lead-up to the crisis, these instruments acquired mammoth proportions and comic levels of complexity. Although some form of derivitives have been traded in for over a century, these instruments really came into their own after the 1980's. Blinder, in his aforementioned book, states:

>*"The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the industry’s trade association, estimates that the notional value of outstanding privately negotiated derivatives—mostly interest-rate swaps—amounted to under $1 trillion at the end of 1987. But they grew like kudzu, to $11 trillion by the end of 1992 and a staggering $69 trillion by 2001."*

As noted in Section 2-1, the safe-asset shortage meant that there was a demand for these types of securities, not only from international buyers, but also from domestic ones. In the hunger to satiate this demand, firms were willing to mortgage  loan  originators  were  happy to dig deeper into the pool of risky borrowers because they were earning fees from originating loans. Blinder provides an example of some of the lending practices in subrpime markets:

>*Consider the sad case of Alberto and Rosa Ramirez, a pair of Mexican American strawberry pickers in California whose annual income was in the $12,000 to $15,000 range and whose English was marginal at best. Egged on and assisted by an unscrupulous real estate agent looking for a big commission, the Ramirezes obtained a $720,000 mortgage from the notorious (and now bankrupt) New Century Financial Corporation to buy a $720,000 house. Yes, you read that right: They didn’t put a penny down, and the mortgage was forty-eight to sixty times their annual income! The real estate agent apparently recorded their income as $12,000 per month and their occupations as “field technicians.” Slight errors. The Ramirezes moved into their McMansion with another family, and somehow, including receiving financial help from the real estate agent, managed to hang on for a few years before defaulting and losing their home to foreclosure.*

These mortagages were packaged up into assets such as mortgage backed securities (MBS) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). Investors in these securities also bought insurance against possible losses. These insurance contracts were called credit default swaps (CDS). From Blinder:

>*A CDS is an insurance contract posing as a derivative. The seller insures the buyer against loss from the default of a particular bond. If the bond does default, the insurer pays off. In return, the “policyholder” makes periodic “premium” payments to the insurer—just as you do with your life and automobile insurance policies. If the bond never defaults, which is the usual case, the seller wins and the buyer loses. But in the event of default, the seller loses big time. It’s classic insurance: The insurer incurs very large losses, but only rarely.*

>*Why have derivative contracts like that in the first place? The original reason was to allow investors to hedge against the risk of nonpayment. Suppose I own a $1 million General Motors bond and become worried that GM might default. I could go to a big insurer like AIG—to pick a nonrandom example—and purchase a CDS on the bond. Under this contract, I would agree to pay AIG periodic insurance premiums. But if GM subsequently defaulted, AIG would absorb the loss. AIG would relieve me of the risk of default—for a fee, of course. That’s what insurance companies do. In short order, however, the use of CDS for hedging became dwarfed by their use for gambling—that is, for placing bets on, for example, whether GM would default—no ownership of GM bonds required.*

Some economists [have argued against these so-called "naked CDSs".](http://voxeu.org/article/credit-default-swaps-useful-misleading-dangerous)

>*Like almost all the financial innovations in recent years, naked CDSs are said to be a beneficial move towards more complete markets. But a key lesson of the financial crisis is that some innovations have been dysfunctional and dangerous...A more serious justification of naked CDSs is that the overall CDS market, of which these are the dominant component, improves pricing efficiency. The CDS market leads the cash bond market in price discovery and in predicting credit events.*

>*Naked CDSs do add liquidity to the market. But is the extra liquidity worth the costs? The most obvious cost is the moral hazard arising when it is possible to insure without an ‘insurable interest’ – as in taking out life insurance on someone else’s life.*

>*The most important concern is related to this moral hazard. Naked CDSs may be a key link in a vicious chain. Buy CDSs low, push down the underlying (eg, short it), and take a profit from both. Meanwhile, the rise in CDS prices will raise the cost of funding of the reference entity – it normally cannot issue at a rate that will not cover the cost of insuring the exposure. That will harm its fiscal or cash flow position. Then there will be more bets on default, or at least on a further rise in the CDS price. If market participants believe that others will bet similarly, then we have the equivalent of a ‘run’. There is clearly an incentive for coordinated manipulation. The probability of default is not independent of the cost of borrowing – hence there may be multiple equilibria, with self-fulfilling expectations (see Cohen and Portes 2006).*

In 2008 it was estimated that about 80 percent of CDS outstanding were “naked”—that is, were pure financial bets rather than hedges. A lot of investors bought risky CDOs and MBS and insured against loss by also buying CDS's. As a side note, AIG collapsed because it sold too much of this kind of insurance, and when the value of the underlying assets crashed, AIG found itself unable to pay out the claims on all its CDS obligations. [My aforementioned post has more on this topic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/5nx2mm/glassstegall_would_have_saved_us/)

There are many practices that I have not documented. "NINJA loans" (no-jobs-no-assets), adjustable rate mortgages, synthetic CDOs, CDO^2s, CDO^3s, option ARMs (a borrower had a choice each month to pay the full payment, pay just interest or pay less than just the interest, thus sinking deeper into debt). As Blinder puts it:

>*Presenting options like those to sophisticated people of means, who may be inclined to take calculated gambles on real estate, is fine. But they never should have been offered to unsophisticated—sometimes barely literate—borrowers who could ill afford to take a loss. It was disgraceful that they were...The Wall Street financial engineers who created the CDOs and CDO2s were performing mathematical exercises with complex securities; they had no clue about—and little interest in—what was inside. And the ultimate investors, ranging from sophisticated portfolio managers to treasurers of small towns in Norway, were essentially clueless. About all they knew were that some illustrious Wall Street names stood behind the securities—way behind, as it turned out—and that Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s had blessed them with the coveted AAA rating: safe enough for Grandma. If ignorance is bliss, there was a lot of bliss going around before the crash.*

They consider loans originated between 2004 and 2008, which coincides with the boom years of the CLO business, and focus on comparisons of performance within the same bank to avert concerns that differences in loan underwriting standards across banks drive their findings. They find that when banks don't have "skin in the game" (ie when banks make loans that they intend to securitise), the resulting loans have worse quality and perform worse than their "originate-to-hold" counterparts (as opposed to originate-to-distribute).

**Section 2-5: The ratings agencies**

It was not just the big banks that failed in the financial crisis. Institutions which are referred to as "ratings agencies" (led by the big three- Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch) also failed spectacularly in the years leading up to the crisis. There were many dubious securities that received the coveted AAA rating.  Consider that on the eve of the crisis, only the bonds of 6 of 50 US states had that rating. The purpose of this section is to attempt to answer how so much dross got labelled as gold.

- First, the incentive system. The customers of the ratings agencies are not investors, who might use the ratings to inform their decisions, or governments, who have an interest in well functioning financial markets. No. The customers of the ratings agencies are the *very banks that issue the securities in the first place.*

- Second, consider that the issuers of such securities were often in contact with their ratings agencies and "negotiated ratings" became commonplace. To quote Blinder (once again):

>*Suppose our mythical investment bank, FIB, proposed a particular complicated payment structure to a rating agency, which studied it and replied that such a security would merit only a single-A rating. FIB might then respond with an obvious—and not unreasonable—question: “What would we have to do to get Triple-A?” When the rating agency answered this question, FIB could adjust the details of its proposed securitization accordingly and reapply for a rating. What else could the agency do but rate the proposed new security AAA? Again, there is nothing inherently duplicitous about this up-and-back process. That’s how products get improved. But it led to an awful lot of dubiously rated AAA paper.*

- Third, there was also the phenomenon of "ratings shopping." If one ratings agency is willing to rate a security AAA while another decides that the same security is at best a "double-A" (AA), then it is clear which ratings agency will get the business. 

- Fourth, many investors and market participants relied too heavily on ratings. Bernanke writes the following in his memoir:

>*complexity reduced the ability of investors to independently judge the structured products’ quality. Some potential purchasers insisted on more information and greater transparency, but most took the easy way and relied instead on the credit ratings. When AAA-rated securities that contained subprime mortgages began to go bad, those investors did not have their own analysis to fall back on. Contagion reared its ugly head. Just as depositors in 1907 ran on any bank with a whiff of a connection to the bankrupt stock speculators, investors a century later pulled back en masse from any structured credit product that might carry the subprime virus.*

There is research showing that "ratings shopping" did infact occur. The reader would be well advised to review the following papers:

- [Do bond issuers shop for a better credit rating?](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/events/rtf06maehlmann.pdf) by Thomas Mählmann. The paper analyses a sample of 15,709 US bond issuers with ratings from both, Moody's and S&P, over the period from 1999 to 2004 of which 3,268 issuers also have a third rating from Fitch. The main finding is:

>*Our empirical results indicate that issuers do indeed shop for better credit ratings from Fitch and that this behavior is driven by lower than average standards applied by Fitch to particular US issuers having both mandatory ratings. These results are robust to alternative specifications of the different submodels. The observed higher average ratings from Fitch, documented in previous studies and also found in this paper, are therefore not the result of higher overall rating scales, but of Fitch's strategically lowering of standards for selected issuers.*

- [Rating Shopping in the CMBS Market](https://www.federalreserve.gov/events/conferences/2011/rsr/papers/Cohen.pdf) by Andrew Cohen. Cohen examines securities in the commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) market issued between 2001 and 2007. The main finding is:

>*The empirical results reveal that: (1) the relationship between ex-ante measures of credit risk and AAA subordination levels differed over time; (2) AAA subordination levels were affected by variables related to rating shopping incentives; and (3) these effects differed over time. Taken together, the evidence supports the claim that rating shopping contributed to the downward trend in credit support levels over the sample period.*

- [Rating Shopping or Catering? An Examination of the Response to Competitive Pressure for CDO Credit Ratings](https://www.sef.hku.hk/~yjtang/GriffinNickersonTang2013RFS-RatingShoppingOrCatering.pdf) by John Griffin, Jordon Nickerson & Dragon Yongjun Tang. This is an interesting paper which seeks to answer whether the behaviour of ratings agencies could best be characterised by the term "rating shopping," whereby the clients of these agencies (ie the issuers of the securities) hunted around for the best rating or by "ratings catering" whereby ratings agencies, under the heat of competitive pressure, followed their competitors up the "ratings chain" when convenient.

The main findings are:

>*Although investors paid a premium for dual ratings, AAA CDO tranches rated by both Moody’s and S&P defaulted more frequently than tranches rated by only one of them, which is inconsistent with pure rating shopping.*

>*We find that S&P issues more positive AAA size adjustments when they encounter competitive pressure from Moody’s. Similarly, Moody’s is more likely to issue a positive adjustment when S&P uses more favorable assumptions. S&P’s and Moody’s adjustments and disagreements were not reflected in yields at issuance. Although the agencies disagreed on underlying assumptions and agreed on ratings at issuance, they later revert back to their initial underlying credit risk assessment. Although we cannot entirely rule out other possible interpretations, the results are generally consistent with rating agencies going beyond their models due to competitive pressure.*

This paper uses a smaller dataset of 716 CDO transactions to reach the conclusion that ratings agencies "gave in" to competitive pressure. This behaviour is similar to "ratings shopping" with the only difference being that instead of the customer applying pressure on a ratings agency to inflate the rating of a particular security, the rating agency *does so anyway anticipating that if it does not revise the rating upwards, it will lose business.* (ie "ratings catering).

**Section 3: Conclusion**

The financial crisis of 2008 was the largest events in economic history since the great depression. It is not surprising that there exists a voluminous literature on both the causes and the responses to the crisis. The purpose of this FAQ has been to explain the causes of the crisis while ignoring the response. Due to length considerations, I have tried to provide source material, links to academic literature, and other assorted articles and summaries to provide the reader with the opportunity to explore the topic further.

Much remains to be written. The response of governments and central banks around the world, the various stimulus, QE and bailout programmes, the various regulatory responses, and changes to the structure of the financial system are all topics that have received short shrift in this entry as those topics lie outside the remit of this write-up. There was no "one cause" to the crisis and no "silver bullet" that can prevent a repeat performance. Financial crises and bubbles have been a part of human history for centuries from the [Tulip mania](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160419-tulip-mania-the-flowers-that-cost-more-than-houses) in the 17th century to the [various assorted financial and banking crises](https://www.economist.com/media/pdf/this-time-is-different-reinhart-e.pdf) that dozens of countries have been through over the course of their histories.

Several factors contributed to the crisis in 2008 and it is important to have a clear understanding of these factors, how they interacted and their relative importance if one is to have an intelligent and thoughtful discussion about the lessons we can draw from this unfortunate event. I hope that this FAQ entry helps in some small way in that endeavour.
