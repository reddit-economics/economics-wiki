##Protectionism and Trade in the Developing World

Discussion frequently occurs whether free trade is beneficial for developing countries or not. Most of the [previous FAQ section on trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_trade) has focused on the dynamics within rich countries.

The purpose of this section is to summarize the evidence regarding the effects of trade on developing countries. The article is structured in the following manner:

-	Section I: Does openness lead to growth?
-	Section II: An overview of the infant industry argument
-	Section III: Does protectionism work?
-	Section IV: Conclusion, sources & further reading

###Section I: Does openness lead to growth?

Let us start this section with an unavoidable, incontrovertible fact stated succinctly by Angus Deaton, [who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2015](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2015/popular-economicsciences2015.pdf) for his research about consumption levels and poverty:

>Angus Deaton: if you are thinking about globalization from whatever perspective, you acknowledge the first fact that you acknowledge there (sic): which is that hundreds of millions of people have come out of poverty because of this. And these people in China and those people in India. And it's not just people in China and India; but they are the countries with the biggest numbers, being brought out of terrible destitution by globalization. So, if you are going to start bitching about globalization because of what it does to people in rich countries, then you've always got to keep that in the other pan of the scales, as it were. And that doesn't mean that there aren't people in rich countries who aren't hurt by this. But however you weight those things, you've got to acknowledge that fact.

[These remarks were made during an interview in October 2016.](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2016/10/angus_deaton_on.html) Deaton is correct: liberalization of both the Chinese and Indian economies has lifted millions out of poverty. China alone [pulled 680 million people out of misery in 1981-2010, and reduced its extreme-poverty rate from 84% in 1980 to 10% now.](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21578665-nearly-1-billion-people-have-been-taken-out-extreme-poverty-20-years-world-should-aim)

India has liberalised (economically, not politically) at a slower pace, and consequently, has had less success in emulating its neighbour. However, the story there has been similar. Datt et al. (2016) found evidence of a structural break pre and post liberalisation (in the year 1991) in the[ rates of poverty reduction in India.](http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromMay2014/dattfig2.png)

[Datt et. al (2016) write:](http://voxeu.org/article/revisiting-poverty-reduction-india-60-years-data)

>“Even though a trend decline in poverty emerged around the early 1970s, the year 1991-92 – the benchmark year for economic reforms in India – stands out as the year of the great divide. Markers of a structural break are many. There was a significant spurt in economic growth, driven by growth in the tertiary sector and to a lesser extent, secondary sector. The pace of poverty reduction also accelerated, with a three- to fourfold increase in the proportionate rate of decline in the post-1991 period.”

With all that said, [it should be unsurprising that globalisation tends to be quite popular in developing countries](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/20161119_WOC333_2.png) even though there is [evidence that it increases inequality.](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21613280-why-globalisation-not-reducing-inequality-within-developing-countries-revisiting) While inequality between rich and poor countries has fallen, inequality in some developing countries has increased due to globalisation.

There is evidence that free trade promotes growth. [In a classic paper on the subject](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/AER_June99.pdf), economists David Romer and Jeffrey Frankel find that “trade has a quantitatively large and robust, though only moderately statistically significant, positive effect on income.”  The paper is important for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it was published in 1999, before the bulk of the reduction in the Chinese poverty figures had taken place. Secondly, it attempts to go beyond correlation and tries to identify causality from free trade to income growth by using an instrumental variables approach. The authors use data on bilateral trade from 1985 spanning 63 countries. Here is what they find:

>“First, we find no evidence that the positive association between international trade and income arises because countries whose incomes are high for other reasons engage in more trade. On the contrary, in every specification we consider, the IV estimate of the effect of trade is larger than the OLS estimate, often by a considerable margin…

>…Second, the point estimates suggest that the impact of trade is substantial. In a typical specification, the estimates imply that increasing the ratio of trade to GDP by one percentage point raises income per person by one-half and two percent.”

As mentioned above, trade may have distributional consequences for the population of developing countries, just like it does for their developed counterparts. The GINI coefficient in China alone has risen by approximately 34% between 1993 and 2008.

Let us turn to Mexico where NAFTA has integrated Mexico’s economy [far more closely with that of the United States.](http://imgur.com/QZYYZ9d)

The impact of NAFTA on Mexico has been broadly positive. In [Section VII of an IMF report, the authors try and answer the question of whether NAFTA increased Mexico’s growth prospects by reviewing the literature.](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp0459.pdf) Kose, Meridith and Towe (2004) write:

>“Recent research shows that NAFTA also contributed to total factor productivity in 
Mexico. For example, Lopez-Cordova (2002) use plant-level data for the period 1993–99 and analyse the relationship between Mexico’s manufacturing productivity and a variety of variables, including tariff rates in Mexico and the United States. He reports that NAFTA raised total factor productivity by roughly 10 percent in Mexico over the sample period, partly in response to foreign capital inflows. In a related paper, Schiff and Wang (2002) use data for 16 manufacturing industries over the period 1981–98 and establish a positive link between total factor productivity in Mexico and the increase in the volume of intermediate inputs trade after NAFTA. In particular, they estimate that NAFTA increased total factor productivity in Mexico by 5.5–7.5 percent.”

In short, there is a wealth of evidence regarding the effects of free trade and growth in the developing world, including a great deal of further evidence which space does not permit us to discuss here.

###Section II: An overview of the infant industry argument

The infant-industry argument is the argument that a government must protect domestic industry until such a time that it can become competitive. The key argument often made is one regarding scale: until such a time that domestic industry can “gain a foothold,” it must be protected. [It can be shown, in theory, that such a policy can be welfare increasing if the domestic supply curve shifts to the right after the policy has been removed](http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch100/T100-4.php) (since an infant industry policy is temporary by nature). Rather than regurgitating a textbook example, I implore all of you to read the discussion presented in the previous link.  However, two substantial problems exist with the argument:

-	Political economy problems: Political pressure can make infant industry protections hard to revoke. See the discussion around trade have diffuse gains but concentrated losers. It is inevitable that industry interests, which presumably lobbied hard for such protection, will chafe at the prospect of its removal. If the protection is permanent, this provides little incentive for firms to incur the investment costs necessary to compete in the global market. In other words, the “infants” may never “grow up.”

-	Informational problems: For such an argument to work, the government must be able to “pick winners.” In other words, it must be able to see into the future some comparative advantage where none exists currently. Beyond that, they must also decide how large the protective tariffs should be and how long they should be in place for. The policy has to be implemented “just right” such that the efficiency gains from such a tariff are not outweighed by the welfare losses.

In the next section, we will examine the empirical track record of such policies and others.

###Section III: Does protectionism work?

There is a reason why Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic advisers (CEA) under President Obama, [once responded to an IGM poll which asked whether import duties would be a good idea with just one word: “stupid.”](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/import-duties) The evidence, on balance, suggests that most protectionist policies are futile at best, and harmful at worst.

Let us return to the infant industry argument. [One study analysed firm-level data in Turkey](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/econ/Krueger,%2520An%2520Empirical%2520Test%2520of%2520the%2520Infant.pdf) to examine whether protection increased productivity growth in protected industies, as advocates of the infant industry argument have often asserted. Krueger & Tuncer (1982) , and found that "protection did not elicit the sort of growth in output per unit of input on which infant industry proponents base their claim for protection." They also found that once outliers were excluded, there was no difference between the productivity of protected versus unprotected industries.

Industrial policy [has not had a good track record in Latin America.](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140920_AMC713.png) A recent report by the Inter-American development bank, even went so far as to rebrand “industrial policy” as “productive development policies” because of the dismal record of such policies in the region. [The Economist magazine wrote:](http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21618785-case-modern-industrial-policy-latin-americas-korean-dream)

>“Industrial policy, as it used to be called, went out of fashion in the region in the 1980s, and for good reason. In Latin America it was mainly deployed in the cause of import substitution. All too often, it sheltered favoured low-productivity firms from the foreign competition that would have made them more efficient. In South Korea, by contrast, industrial policy was more ruthless: state help for businesses was temporary and linked to performance in exports and innovation.”

[An IMF study by Choudhri & Hakura (2000),](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2000/wp0017.pdf) which used data spanning 44 countries, of which 33 were developing countries, found: 

>The paper estimates an empirical relation based on Krugman's 'technological gap' model to explore the influence of the pattern of international trade and production on the overall productivity growth of a developing country. **A key result is that increased import competition in medium-growth (but not in low- or high-growth) manufacturing sectors enhances overall productivity growth.** The authors also find that a production-share weighted average of (technological leaders’) sectoral productivity growth rates has a significant effect on the rate of aggregate productivity growth.

There are however, isolated examples of such a policy working. [A paper, published in 2002, which asked whether Danish windmill subsidies were worthwhile found positive welfare effects:](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5160996_The_Establishment_of_the_Danish_Windmill_Industry_-_Was_It_Worthwhile)

>“The paper examines the welfare effects of the Danish subsidies granted for the electricity production from wind power. This policy has induced a remarkable development of the Danish windmill industry resulting in a dominant position on the world market. The article demonstrates a strong learning-by-doing productivity growth in the Danish windmill industry and it analyses the costs and benefits of this infant industry case. The costs consist of the efficiency loss from diverting electricity production from using fossil fuels to utilizing wind power. Benefits are the reductions in the environmental damage of using fossil fuels, however, the main benefits are related to the emergence of a new export sector. As the value of the windmill firms at the stock exchange by far exceeds that of the accumulated distorted losses in electricity production, this case demonstrates a successful infant industry strategy.”

Here, we should note that these protections were subsidies, and not tariffs. 

Another study, by Richard Baldwin and Paul Krugman, in 1986 [asked a similar question of Japanese semiconductor protections.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w1936) They found that such protections resulted in large welfare costs for both Japan and the United States. 

Similarly, Brazil’s attempt to protect its computer industry backfired.  [Luzio and Greenstein (1995) wrote:](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/econ/Luzio,%2520Brazilian%2520Microcomputers.pdf)

>“Our analysis highlights rapid rates of advance in Brazil but lower rates than potential international competition. Technical frontiers typically lagged price/performance practices in international markets by at least three years and as much as five. **Foregone buyer surplus due to protection had to be quite high, approaching 20% of domestic expenditure on microcomputers.**”

The evidence in developed countries is hardly better. [A report by the Peterson Institute analyzing the impact of US tire tariffs](https://piie.com/sites/default/files/publications/pb/pb12-9.pdf), introduced by President Obama in 2009 found the following:

>**“The cost per job manufacturing saved (a maximum of 1,200 jobs by our calculations) was at least $900,000 in that year.** Only a very small fraction of this bloated figure reached the pockets of tire workers. Instead, most of the money landed in the coffers of tire companies, mainly abroad but also at home. The additional money that US consumers spent on tires reduced their spending on other retail goods, indirectly lowering employment in the retail industry. **On balance, it seems likely that tire protectionism cost the US economy around 2,531 jobs, when losses in the retail sector are offset against gains in tire manufacturing.”**

In this example, the United States would have been better off paying each of the 1,200 workers  $100,000 per year to sit idle and still reaped a surplus of $800,000 per worker.

It should be noted that there is evidence that export promotion, of the sort South Korea tried, can be helpful in some circumstances. South Korea’s policies enforced harsh discipline by setting export quotes and ensuring that domestic firms faced a mixture of both government and market discipline. The infant industry argument turns problematic when inefficient and loss-making industries are coddled. In the rare instances where industrial policy has worked, it has been through subsidy and the discipline which comes from exposure to foreign competition (ie: more trade, not less). This observation is consistent with Choudri & Hokura (2000). 

###Section IV: Conclusion

An analysis of free trade in the developing world would be complete without noting that trade helps the poor disproportionately in both developed and developing countries. [A 2014 study by Fajgelbaum & Khandelwal](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20331) attempted to quantify this benefit. They reported the following after looking at more than 20 countries, both developing and developed:

>“We find a pro-poor bias of trade in every country. **On average, the real income loss from closing off trade is 63 percent at the 10th percentile of the income distribution and 28 percent for the 90th percentile.** This bias in the gains from trade toward poor consumers hinges on the fact that these consumers spend relatively more on sectors that are more traded, while high-income individuals consume relatively more services, which are among the least traded sectors.”

Trade and globalisation have been driving forces in reducing global poverty rates and bringing tens of millions of people out of destitution. No policy is without its costs, and free trade is no exception.  But despite these costs, on net free trade has helped developing countries gain access to new markets, and arguments that protectionism would benefit developing countries go against the best available evidence.
