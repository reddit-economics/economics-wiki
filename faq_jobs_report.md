# FAQ: Jobs Report
(by /u/MrDannyOcean & /u/Ponderday)

The purpose of this FAQ to provide a layman with a comfortable understanding of how to read a jobs report from the BLS.  The most recent jobs report can always be found directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at [this link](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm).

-------------------------
## Unemployment Basics

##Who does the BLS Count as Unemployed?

The government considers someone unemployed if (1) they have not done any work for pay, or worked at a family owned business in the last week, and (2) have looked for a job in the last four weeks.  All others are either employed or out of the labor force.  The second point is important, this means that people who don't have a job but are not looking either by choice or because they have given up on the idea of finding a job are not considered unemployed.  

##Are there alternative ways to measure unemployment?

Yes- in fact there are several definitions of unemployment.  The large majority of the time when we speak about unemployment, we're referring to the U3 or 'headline' unemployment figure, which is defined above.  There are alternative definitions ranging from U1 to U6, with U1 always being the strictest definition and the lowest of the unemployment rates, and U6 being the loosest and highest of the unemployment rates.  U6 counts people who aren't looking for jobs but are 'discouraged workers' and also some part-time employees as unemployed, while U1 only counts workers as unemployed if they have been out of work for 15 weeks or more. 

None of these definitions are right or wrong - they just measure different situations.  Historically the different measures move in the same direction - if one version of the unemployment rate is rising (or falling), the other versions will be rising (or falling) in [a very similar manner](http://www.macrotrends.net/1377/u6-unemployment-rate).

Current U1 through U6 unemployment rates can be seen in [Table A-15](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm).

##What is the labor force?

The labor force includes all people who are employed, or who do not have a job but are searching for one.  It is important to note that being outside the labor force and being unemployed are two separate things.  Someone who is looking for a job and cannot find one is different than someone who is not employed because they don't want a job.  There are far more people outside the labor force than there are unemployed people.  For examples, consider the many students, stay-at-home parents, retirees, etc., who do not want to hold full time jobs.  

The percent of people in the population in the labor force is measured by the [labor force participation rate](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000) (LFPR).

##Is it bad that we don't have zero unemployment?

Not necessarily.  Some unemployment in the economy is natural as it takes time for workers to find jobs when entering the labor force, or quitting jobs they do not like.  Even in the best of times companies fail and workers are laid off. Some amount of job churn is inevitable.  This type of unemployment is called 'frictional unemployment'.  By contrast, unemployment caused by a downturn in the greater economy is called 'cyclical unemployment'.  Economists are concerned with cyclical, not frictional unemployment.  

The [natural rate of unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rate_of_unemployment) is the unemployment rate where only frictional, and no cyclical unemployment exists.  It is typically thought to be around [4-5%](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14424.htm) by most economists.  


#Common Questions about the Jobs Report numbers


##Do the job numbers control for seasonal trends like the holidays? 

Yes.  The numbers are seasonally adjusted and they factor in the fact that the unemployment rate tends to move in certain ways at certain times of the year.  This means that any given month is comparable to another, even though stores may hire more workers during the holiday season. 

##I see that jobs were added this month: Are all the jobs being added low paying jobs in retail?  Are they part time jobs?

The exact answer to this question will obviously change month to month, but the BLS does track these numbers.  Job numbers by industry are available in [Table B-6](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t22.htm).  Part time and full time job numbers are available in [Table A-8](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm).  The Great Recession saw a huge spike in part time work, but part time work has been [declining steadily since 2010](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12032194). 

The BLS also breaks down the job numbers by a number of different demographic variables including race, gender, age, and more in the various tables provided on the jobs report page.

##What is considered a good jobs report?

There are a number of factors that go into a 'good' jobs report.  A few (but not all) of the indicators that economists tend to watch closely are

* The headline number of jobs added
* The unemployment rates, specifically U3 and U6
* The labor force participation rate
* The hourly wage data

In a typical month, it is considered good news if a significant number of jobs are added, unemployment falls (or remains low), hourly wages increase, and labor force participation increases.  How large should these increases be?  There's no exact formula for what is considered 'good', but there are a few useful guidelines. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimates that the 'break-even' number of created jobs needed to keep up with population growth is somewhere between [50,000 and 110,000](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2016/october/trend-job-growth-where-is-normal/).  Economists like to see wage growth that outpaces inflation so that worker's real wages are increasing.  Since the Great Recession, inflation has mostly hovered between 1-2%, so nominal wage growth well above 2% is typically considered positive.  Nominal wage growth right at or below 2% would typically not be considered positive.

##What are revisions?  Are these numbers fudged up or down?

The initially reported numbers are an estimate based on the available data at the time of release.  As new data becomes available, more accurate estimates can be reported.  The BLS updates their estimates [twice in the two months after the initial jobs report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.faq.htm).  On average, the final reported jobs number is about [13,000 jobs higher](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesnaicsrev.htm) than the initial jobs number, and the average size of the miss is about 54,000 jobs (as of January 2018).  These numbers are estimates and subject to revision, so economists normally encourage observers to note trends over time rather than individual data points.
