# Introduction

A common misconception is that automation will cause long term, [structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_unemployment) unemployment. The line of thinking often leads to a prescription of an expansion of the social safety net, sometimes in the form of a [universal basic income](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_basicincome) or an equivalent welfare scheme. 

While a universal basic income is not necessarily a bad idea, it is not a good prescription to address the problems automation is predicted to cause (a proposed basic income welfare scheme should stand on its own merits).

This rhetoric diverts attention away from real problems that automation could create, and the targeted solutions we should advocate for.

# Will human be useless?

**1) Will humans be useless? (Does automation cause long run structural unemployment?)**

No. 

At least, not until the [AI singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). The argument often comes from [CGP Grey's "Humans need not apply"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) which, while well produced, is [not supported by the research and consensus of experts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/35m6i5/low_hanging_fruit_rfuturology_discusses/cr6utdu/). 

It's important to note that the vast majority of workers (>90%) before the industrial revolution worked in agriculture, and that this number is now less than 5%. Why did the automation of agriculture not lead to widespread, long term unemployment?  This is because disruptive technologies have multiple effects. They:

- Destroy existing jobs

- Complement existing jobs (by making them more efficient)

- Create new jobs

- Reallocate the workforce to where it is most productive


Note that only one of those four effects causes *long run* job loss. Two of those cause job loss in general (job reallocation implies job loss in the short term, after all). 

For automation to cause long run structural unemployment, the new technology needs not only to destroy jobs and create no new jobs, but it also needs to somehow prevent reallocation of workers to other sectors of the economy.

AI, at its current state, is a collection of applied technologies specialized to certain tasks (including recent developments in deep neural networks). For example, self driving car has no concept of what it is doing, it is only a very complex decision tree paired with precise sensors. The best current self driving car could not play chess, or even go offroad, because it is specialized to its task.

While AI may displace different skillsets compared to historical automation innovations, it is not substantatively different in principle. Remember that before the first industrial revolution, the overwhelming majority of the workforce was employed in agriulture while now this number is less than 5%. When tasks get automated, new tasks come up in the economy, because jobs are not zero sum (recall the [lump of labor fallacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_immigration))

**2) What should we be concerned about instead?**

Two things: short run structural unemployment, and inequality

*Short run structural unemployment*

This works much like you would intuitively expect. A worker's specific skillset becomes automated, he loses his job, and needs to find a new one. Except on a potentially very large scale.

Note that in the short run we can't expect "new tasks" to arrive at a sufficient pace to compensate for a sudden shock to the labor market coming from new automation technology. A potential example of this would be self driving trucks erasing all long haul trucking jobs in the matter of a few weeks or months.

This works very similarly to a shock in [trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_trade). In fact, the majority of the manufacturing job loss in the US which is often politically blamed on trade is in fact due to automation.

The effects, as for trade, are that the vast majority of the population benefits greatly from the change, but a small subset of the population suffers greatly, with the overall effect in the economy being overwhelmingly positive. The policy response to help the ones losing from this situation has been historically very poor if any at all. We recommended a reading the FAQ section on trade.

*Inequality*

[David Autor](http://economics.mit.edu/files/9835) makes the case, which is at this point [agreed upon](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Artificial-Intelligence-Automation-Economy.PDF) that automation is set to greatly increase economic inequality. 

First, most tasks currently being automated tend to be low skill, which puts downward pressure on labor demand for low wage worker. Second, in the long run, we could possibly see a [polarization between high skill and low skill jobs](http://economics.mit.edu/files/9835), hollowing out middle skill jobs. Third, the productivity gains from automation could simply not translate into wage increases (depending on bargaining power of workers and market structure of industries) which would translate into an increase in inequality between wage income and capital income.

**What should we advocate for?**

Reading the above, we are equipped to say that a UBI is not a proper response to the threats that automation pose, because it does not specifically adress the issues that are likely to come. While a UBI welfare scheme could be argued on its own merits, it would provide little help here.

[Jason Furman, Obama's Chief Economic Advisor](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Artificial-Intelligence-Automation-Economy.PDF) advocates for the following policies:

 - Keep investing in AI because the benefits massively outweigh the negatives.
 
 - Ensure more widely accessible and flexible education for all to prepare for jobs of the future
 
 - Aid workers in job transitions
 
 - Ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared
