[*Economics Rules*](https://www.amazon.com/Economics-Rules-Rights-Wrongs-Science/dp/1511372664) by Dani Rodrik is a great book for further reading on the topics in this FAQ. It includes citations to many other philosophers of economics and science in general. [Here](https://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2016/01/book-review-economics-rules.html) is Noah Smith’s review of the book.

###Is economics a science?

----

Yes. Although no consistent [demarcation criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem) has ever been found by philosophers of science, economics can be considered a science by the same common criteria we use to argue that disciplines like physics and biology are sciences. Common questions about economics' status as a science are addressed below. 


####**Do economists follow the scientific method?**

It’s trivially true that they do. Indirect evidence for this claim includes the existence of meta-analysis in economics, as well as the fact that *Science*, the most important scientific journal in the world, has an economics section. Direct evidence can be found in any major economics journal. Peruse an economics paper, and you’ll see that economists accumulate empirical facts, formulate theoretical models to explain those facts, derive testable hypotheses, and subject them to intense empirical scrutiny.

Now, like any science, economics as practiced sometimes diverges from the ideal scientific method. The “file drawer problem” and publication bias exist. Null results are less publishable. Replications don’t occur or publish as frequently as we say we’d like. Peer review usually isn’t double blind. Data and code are usually not required to be provided to publish. And many times you’ll find “working papers” that have yet to be peer reviewed are cited in published papers. 


####**Does any credible natural scientist (physicist, biologist, etc) consider economics a science?**

Carl Sagan did. In his book, *Demon-Haunted World*, Sagan matches each science with its corresponding pseudosciences. From page 55 of my edition:

>Physicists have perpetual motion machines, an army of amateur relativity disprovers, and perhaps cold fusion. Chemists still have alchemy. Psychologists have much of psychoanalysis and almost all of parapsychology. Economists have long-range economic forecasting.


####**Economists couldn’t predict the Financial Crisis and Great Recession. Why should I ever listen to economists?**

First, the existence/accuracy of forecasting is not a necessary condition for something to be useful or a science. Paleontologists and evolutionary biologists cannot forecast. Meteorologists, seismologists, and many other scientists frequently fail to accurately forecast events--sometimes with deadly consequences. If failure to predict critical events was the hallmark of not-science, then much of science wouldn’t be science. 

Second, economics does not equal macroeconomics. Macro is a subset of economics, and macroeconomic forecasting is a subset of macroeconomics. Judging the validity of an entire discipline for the perceived failure of a sub-sub-discipline is illogical. The vast majority of economists are not macroeconomic forecasters; in addition, it’s not even the average *macro*-economist’s job to predict recessions. 

Third, some economists did see a crisis on the horizon. This includes Janet Yellen, former chair of the Federal Reserve. Regardless, just as seismologists have learned from Tohoku, macroeconomists have learned from the Crisis. 


####**Are there laws of economics?**

This depends on your definition of “law.” If by “law” you mean “universally valid statement, true regardless of any context,” then there would be very few laws in *any* science. 

Consider physics. Newtonian physics has a broad range of applications, but is invalid at high speeds and high gravity. General Relativity and Newtonian physics are both invalid at the quantum level. The physicist [Steven Weinberg](http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/weinberg.html) puts it this way:

>There is another complication here, which is that none of the laws of physics known today (with the possible exception of the general principles of quantum mechanics) are exactly and universally valid. Nevertheless, many of them have settled down to a final form, valid in certain known circumstances. The equations of electricity and magnetism that are today known as Maxwell’s equations are not the equations originally written down by Maxwell; they are equations that physicists settled on after decades of subsequent work by other physicists, notably the English scientist Oliver Heaviside. They are understood today to be an approximation that is valid in a limited context (that of weak, slowly-varying electric and magnetic fields), but in this form and in this limited context they have survived for a century and may be expected to survive indefinitely. This is the sort of law of physics that I think corresponds to something as real as anything else we know.

Similarly, economic models are approximations of reality, valid when applied to certain contexts. 
It may be true that, for instance, Newtonian physics has a broader range of application than any economic model, but this means the difference between physics and economics is in degree, not in kind. Economics is composed of a large library of models, each of which is valid in a given class of contexts where its **critical assumptions** are empirically valid.

A critical assumption is one which, when relaxed (made more "realistic"), changes the conclusion we wish to test in a given context. For examples and more info on this issue, see **"Theoretical economic models are too simplistic"** below.


####**Can economists reach consensus on any issue?**

They [can](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18728.pdf). The Chicago Booth School conducts the [IGM Survey](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel) of 50+ top US academic economists, asking their opinions on topics of general interest. Ctrl + F on that page for a given topic, and it’s likely to come up. Before expressing your opinion on any topic in economics, it's a good idea to check the IGM survey to see what economists think about it. [Econofact](http://econofact.org/) is another resource for anyone to find expert opinion on economic issues. [*The Journal of Economic Perspectives*](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jep) publishes literature reviews geared toward a more general audience than pure academia. *The Journal of Economic Literature* and the *Journal of Economic Surveys* go more in depth.


####**Aren’t economic models just common sense?**

It was once considered common sense that the Earth is flat and that leeches can cure a variety of ailments. Trying to shut down debate by appealing to common sense is anti-scientific. As Einstein put it, “The whole of science is nothing but a refinement of everyday thinking.”

Further, economic models often force us to consider countervailing forces, and the interaction of these forces can be counterintuitive. Consider the simplest economic model taught to every undergraduate: Supply and Demand.

Think about immigration. We want to determine the impact of immigration on the wages of natives. The most common argument is, “It’s simple supply and demand! Immigrants shift the labor supply curve right, which drives down equilibrium wages.” But hold on. Immigrants also buy things and start businesses (and by some estimates are [more entrepreneurial than natives](https://hbr.org/2016/10/why-are-immigrants-more-entrepreneurial)). That means immigration also shifts out the labor demand curve. So what's the overall effect of immigration on native wages? We can't know a priori; when both the supply and demand curve shift in the same direction the overall effect on equilibrium price is theoretically ambiguous. Common sense doesn't help us here.

So using “common sense” isn’t always sensible. Economists use theoretical models to clearly and consistently think about a problem, and find evidence to determine which theoretical possibility actually happened. That’s what scientists do.

###Criticisms of Economics

----

See also Noah Smith’s [Econ Critique Scorecard](https://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/econ-critique-scorecard.html) and [Lazy Econ Critiques](https://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/lazy-econ-critiques.html).


####**Is economics a soft science? Is it less valid than hard sciences?**

There isn’t a consistent criterion for what makes a soft science. Common reasons given for why economics is less valid than other sciences are addressed below.


####**Are theoretical economic models too simplistic?**

[Simplifying assumptions are necessary for any theoretical model in any science.](http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2017/02/all-models-are-wrong-some-are-useful.html#sthash.rXStzuKU.sfju) Economists often start with a baseline model that’s as simple as possible, and add frictions as necessary by relaxing restrictive **critical assumptions**. A critical assumption is one which, when relaxed (made more "realistic"), changes the conclusion we wish to test in a given context.

Consider minimum wages in the labor market. Assuming a perfectly competitive market, a price floor like the MW is predicted to lower employment. The perfect competition assumption includes the "sub-assumption" that employers have no market power to affect the wage. Relax this assumption (i.e., give employers more bargaining power and call it "imperfect competition"), and it’s now possible for a moderate MW to actually increase employment. The testable conclusion of the supply and demand model of the labor market has changed once we assume imperfect competition instead of perfect competition. The assumption of no employer market power is thus a critical one when we want to analyze the effects of minimum wages on employment. 

Now consider taxes on cigarettes. It doesn’t matter if we assume perfect or imperfect competition in the cigarette market; a tax on cigarettes is unambiguously predicted to raise price. In this case, perfect competition is not a critical assumption, as relaxing it wouldn’t alter the conclusion we want to test in this scenario.

[This reasoning applies in natural sciences, as well.](http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2017/02/all-models-are-wrong-some-are-useful.html#sthash.rXStzuKU.sfju) Quote:

>If the goal is to put a satellite into orbit, the equations that define Newton's laws of motion and gravity, though not 100% correct, are more than sufficient; you don't need Einstein's theories of relativity though they would provide a more accurate description. But if the goal is to determine a GPS device's location on earth you do need relativity. [...] So there is this art in modeling, this choosing of some aspects and ignoring others, trying to create the the right approximations.  As [famous statistician George Box] notes: "there is no need to ask the question 'Is the model true?'. If 'truth' is to be the 'whole truth' the answer must be 'No'. The only question of interest is 'Is the model illuminating and useful?'" 

Theoretical models in any science are simplistic for a reason, and can be made more complex when necessary.  This is similar to physics where simple models are explained using perfectly spherical frictionless balls, and complications are added later as necessary.


####**Do economists always assume people are perfectly rational?**

[Behavioral economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics) study what happens when we relax this assumption. Richard Thaler is one of them, and he pioneered the study of behavioral finance. See also the above response to “Theoretical econ models are too simplistic,” as it isn’t always necessary to relax this assumption.


####**Do economists always assume perfect competition?**

No! [Industrial Organization economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_organization) (and many others) study what happens when we relax this assumption. See also the above response to “Theoretical econ models are too simplistic,” as it isn’t always necessary to relax this assumption.


####**Do economists view human behavior as entirely greed-based? What about altruism, social norms, and biology?**

Humans respond to incentives, which can be pecuniary or nonpecuniary. Many economists study social incentives such as stigma, or psychological incentives such as addiction. Humans interact in markets or non-markets. Many economists study non-market behavior, such as household production, health, and schooling. Economists don’t believe humans are greedy as much as they believe humans seek benefits, avoid costs, and interact with each other. There are even economic models for altruistic behavior.


####**Why do economists use complicated math? Do they have physics envy?**

Economists use models, just like other scientists. Economists formulate models using math because math gives our models clarity and consistency. 

Clarity means you know exactly what a model defines, assumes, and concludes. Marxists are still debating what Marx actually meant. No one debates what Kenneth Arrow actually meant, because his statements were in precise mathematical terms.

Consistency means my premises are guaranteed to entail my conclusion. The math forces me to lay my assumptions bare and derive testable conclusions from them. There’s no ambiguity over what I’m assuming. All (publishable) mathematical models are logically consistent. 

So economists aren’t using math just for the sake of appearances. As for physics envy, [eh](https://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2015/05/economists-dont-have-physics-envy.html).


####**Do economists believe that we should promote GDP growth above all other concerns?**

Economists like GDP because it's a simple measure of aggregate economic activity that is highly correlated with things we actually care about and consider reflective of our quality of life, such as education and health care quality, life expectancy, health status, educational attainment, social mobility, good governance, and poverty reduction. The Human Development Index is often seen as a better alternative to GDP, but HDI and GDP are also highly correlated and GDP is easier to calculate. 

When GDP fails to provide us with accurate info on a given topic, economists are not timid to use other indicators. HDI is one. Nighttime illumination, cell phone usage, and satellite images of road networks and buildings can tell us a lot about regional economic activity and, most importantly, underserved impoverished areas. We now have indicators of economic policy uncertainty, immigration anxiety, and average prices updated in real time using “big data.” (See [here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6210/1243089) for more info.)

In sum, economists do not hold up GDP as the immutable measure of living standards.

**Economists can’t run experiments.** 

They can and frequently do (especially microeconomists, behavioral economists, etc), but often macroeconomists can’t. [Experimental economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_economics) can take place in a lab setting or in field, and can study a wide array of fields.  For an overview of modern field experiments, see [Levitt and List 2008](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14356).

**Economists can’t determine causality.  They only report correlations between variables.**

Economists often estimate causal effects. It is a common misconception that most modern empirical economics studies use non-random observational data and vanilla OLS. In fact, if a microeconomist cannot credibly estimate a causal effect, she has no hope of publishing in top journals today.  A perusal of a top economics journal will quickly verify this.

**Empirical economics studies are mostly unreplicable.**

This criticism has become more common since the recent replication crisis in psychology and a few papers trying to replicate economics studies. If most econ results don’t replicate, why should we ever listen to economists?

The replication crisis is a serious problem, but should be viewed in context with other fields.  Various [estimates](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/about-40-economics-experiments-fail-replication-survey) have been [made](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/federal-reserve-paper-on-the-replicability-of-economic-studies-2015-10) and the successful replication rate of economics studies was 50%, 60% or 76% depending on how you measured replication.  These results are worrying, but this replication rate is higher than replication rates for [psychology](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716), [cancer research](http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/23/14324326/replication-science-is-hard), [pharmaceutical research](http://protomag.com/articles/replication-in-research-problem), and many other fields.

Even physics has replication issues from time to time, or prematurely announces non-true findings.  Two of the biggest results in the last decade from physics, the [superliminal neutrinos from OPERA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly) and the [2014 finding of gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) from the dawn of time had to be partially walked back in the face of [new evidence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/achenblog/wp/2015/01/30/planck-flings-dust-at-bicep2-no-discovery-of-gravitational-waves-from-the-big-bang/).  Ideas like cold fusion and the EM Drive are further examples.  While the replication crisis has broad impacts across many fields, economics is not disproportionally impacted and those issues do not stop economics from being a scientific field.
