**Integralds's Reading List**

# Recommended Reading

The best introduction to economics is to pick up an introductory textbook. Mankiw, Cowen/Tabbarok, and Krugman/Wells are all fine choices; the differences between them are minor. However, there are also many books on economics directed at a popular audience. These are no substitute for an intro textbook, but make for fine, enjoyable, and stimulating reading.

--------------

## **General Intro to Economics**

1. Landsburg, *The Armchair Economist,* 1995. This book basically teaches you the first quarter of Micro 101 at a popular, easily-accesible level. He skimps out on market failures but will teach you classic "applied price theory."  This should be read first, because it helps to get a good handle on what economists usually do before branching out into the specifics of different subfields.

2. Harford, *The Undercover Economist,* 2005. Basics of microeconomics, with
some big picture macro thrown in.
 
3. Harford, *The Undercover Economist Strikes Back,* 2014. This is an
introduction to business cycle macroeconomics.

4. Heilbroner, *The Worldly Philosophers,* 1999. This is an excellent introduction to the "history of economic thought" (which is separate from "economic history," mind). It covers major thinkers from Adam Smith through Keynes and Schumpeter.

5. Levitt and Dubner, *Freakonomics,* 2010. This book jump-started the pop-economics trend of the past few years. Readable and enjoyable, although a few of its chapters have not held up well over time.

---------------

## **Microeconomics**

1. Dixit and Nalebuff, *Thinking Strategically,* 1993. This book teaches you the economics of game theory: how individuals act and react when in competition with each other. 

2. Schelling, *Micromotives and Macrobehavior,* 1978, reprint 2006. This is a lovely book that analyzes the various non-intuitive things that happen when we try to aggregate up from individual behavior to societal aggregates. 

3. Roth, *Who Gets What and Why*, 2016. Al Roth (Nobel Laureate 2012) teaches you about the explicit and implicit rules that allow markets to function well, and introduces the field of matching, which uses game theory to study markets in kidneys, dating, and more.

4. Tirole, *Economics for the Common Good,* 2017.

5. Becker and Posner, *Uncommon Sense: Economic Insights from Marriage to Terrorism*, 2010 reprint. The original Freakonomics: Gary Becker pioneered the application of economics to non-economic subject areas.

6. Becker and Becker, *The Economics of Life: From Baseball to Affirmative Action to Immigration, How Real-World Issues Affect Our Everyday Life*, 1998.

7. Becker and Murphy, *Social Economics: Market Behavior in a Social Environment*, 2003.

---------------

## **Behavioral Economics**

1. Kahneman, *Thinking, Fast and Slow,* 2013.  It's often useful to read economics in the context of psychology. This is a solid introduction to behavioral economics, the field of microeconomics that explores the boundaries between economics and psychology. 

2. Thaler and Sunstein, *Nudge,* 2009. This is the second book in the behavioral economics triad. It's useful for its broad swath of interesting and sensible policy recommendations.

3. Ariely, *Predictably Irrational,* 2010. Third book in the behavioral economics triad.

4. Akerlof and Shiller, *Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism*, 2009.

5. Thaler, *Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics*, 2016.

6. Akerlof and Shiller, *Phishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception,* 2015. Two Nobel Laureates apply information and behavioral economics to marketing, politics, and every area where profit-maximization creates incentives for deception.


---------------

## **Finance**

1. Malkiel, *A Random Walk Down Wall Street,* 1973, revised 2012.  This is a classic book on finance and investing, and comparable to Landsburg in that Malkiel lays out the "basic standard" for investing advice from research in economics and finance. It's the only finance book the layman will ever need, and the first one that an person interested in finance should pick up.

2. Rajan, *Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy*, 2011.

3. Mian and Sufi, *House of Debt: How They (and You) Caused the Great Recession, and How We Can Prevent It from Happening Again*, 2015.

4. Shiller, *Finance and the Good Society*, 2013.

5. Shiller, *Irrational Exuberance*, revised 2015.

6. Desai, *The Wisdom of Finance*, 2017.

---------------

## **Macroeconomics**

1. Friedman, *Capitalism and Freedom,* 1962, revised 2002. The classic statement of "market economics." This book was much more radical and necessary in the 1960s, when it was first published; many of its recommendations were taken to heart in the 1980s and 1990s. It remains excellent reading.

2. Friedman, *Free to Choose,* 1980, revised 1990. This is a bit of a companion volume to C&F: longer, more practical, less theoretical, and applied to many institutional arraignments in the economy. 

3. Galbraith, *The New Industrial State,* 1967. If you read Friedman, you owe it to yourself to read Galbraith. Galbraith and Friedman were standard-bearers for their respective economic philosophies and clashed for nearly twenty years. Many of Galbraith's observations on the concentration of industry and importance of union bargaining are outdated, but his message remains important.

4. Galbraith, *The Affluent Society,* 1958, revised 1998. This work is the intellectual foundation of 1990s-era moderate liberalism, and is an important read for that reason alone. This book tackles the hard questions of economic affluence, security, and income inequality.

5. Deaton, *The Great Escape,* 2013. This is a popular book on two important long-run trends: growth in average income per person and the trends in inequality of income across individuals. Deaton describes both the "trend" and the "spread" of income and health outcomes with clarity and precision.
 
6. Reinhart and Rogoff, *This Time is Different*, 2011. On the history of financial crises over several hundred years.
 
7. Snowdon and Vane, *Modern Macroeconomics: Its Origins, Development, and Current State,* 2005. An exposition of the various schools of macroeconomic thought. Requires a year or two of economics training to appreciate, and could easily be a companion book to an intermediate course in macro.


## **Growth**

This is a short list of books that tries to tackle the big questions of economics: why are some countries rich and other countries poor? Is there anything that poor countries can do to make themselves rich?  I'm not going to try to summarize each of these books in one paragraph, but will give a one-word hint as to the answers each provides. None is perfect; none has found the One True Key to economic prosperity. However, taken together, they provide a balanced view of many factors that affect economic growth.


1. Landes, *The Wealth and Poverty of Nations,* 1999. (Culture)

2. De Soto, *The Mystery of Capital,* 2003. (Economic institutions)

3. Acemoglu and Robinson, *Why Nations Fail,* 2012. (Political institutions)

4. Clark, *A Farewell to Alms,* 2008. (More technical. Focuses on productivity, with an emphasis on the Industrial revolution)

## **Development**

These books look specifically at the question, "what can poor countries today do to become rich?" Again, I'm not going to summarize all of them. Many have a special focus on the (in)effectiveness of foreign aid. These books, or part of them, could easily form the core of a syllabus for a course in economic development, pitched at the undergrad level. All of these are geared towards a popular audience.

2. Easterly, *The Elusive Quest for Growth,* 2002.

4. Sachs, *The End of Poverty,* 2006.
5. Sachs, *Common Wealth,* 2009.
6. Collier, *The Bottom Billion,* 2008. Contains an interesting overview of the Easterly-Sachs debate.
7. Collier, *Wars, Guns and Votes,* 2010. Focus on political development in Africa.
8. Cooter and Schafer, *Solomon's Knot,* 2013. Focuses on law and economics.

to the present.

4. Findlay and O'Rourke, *Power and Plenty,* 2009. A sweeping history of global trade from 1000 CE to the present.

5. Lowenstein, *America's Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve,* 2015.  The history of the creation of the Federal Reserve System in the United States.


## **Biographies and Retrospectives**

These are a "view from the trenches," written by economists and practitioners on their time in public service.

1. Rubin, *In an Uncertain World,* 2004. The Clinton economic team.
2. Taylor, *Global Financial Warriors,* 2007. The Bush economic team.

5. Volcker, *Keeping At It,* 2018.

## **Biographies and Retrospectives of the Great Recession**

1. Blinder, *After the Music Stopped,* 2013.  Perhaps the single best book to answer the question "Why did the Great Recession happen?"
2. Wessel, *In Fed We Trust,* 2009. The Bernanke Fed during the crisis.
3. Paulson, *On the Brink,* 2011. Inside the "panic days" of the financial crisis.

in economics. These books provide a look into each path.
 
1. Warsh, *Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations,* 2007.
 
2. Colander, *The Making of an Economist,* 2008. Required reading for anyone thinking about going to graduate school in economics, this book is a critical examination of grad school training. Worth the buy for the interviews alone.

4. Broughton, *Ahead of the Curve,* 2009. Business school.
