
##Recommended Reading

At some point it would really be worthwhile to pick up an intro textbook. Mankiw is good. Cowen/Tabarrok is also good.

###Microeconomics

1. The single best pop-microeconomics book is undoubtedly Landsburg's *The Armchair Economist.* I would suggest putting off reading any of the "new pop econ" (Freakonomics, Undercover Economist, whatever) until after reading *Armchair.*
2. A great second book in micro is Dixit's *Thinking Strategically.* It will teach you how to think like a game theorist without a lick of math.
3. A lovely book that bridges the gap between microeconomics and macroeconomics is Schelling's *Micromotives and Macrobehavior.*  He goes through all kinds of counterintuitive results that happen when you start moving away from individuals and start talking about aggregates.

##Macroeconomics

There are no good primers in macroeconomics. That said, you can read

1. Milton Friedman's *Capitalism and Freedom* 
2. Milton Friedman's *Free to Choose*
3. Galbraith's *The New Industrial State*, and
4. Galbraith's *The Affluent Society.*
5. Perhaps something like Krugman's *Return to Depression Economics.* 

I'm waiting eagerly for someone to write a pop-macro book for this century that doesn't suck. (Recommendations welcome.)

##Other

1. *The Worldy Philosophers* is great on history of thought. So is *Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations*; the latter is particularly readable and a good writeup on the macro schools of thought and how they affected the economics profession through the 60s to 90s.
2. A steady diet of economics dulls the palate. A great book that explores some of the sociological sides of the American economy over the past sixty years, while still being mostly right on the economics, is Richard Florida, *The Rise of the Creative Class.* Really, read Florida, he's lucid in most places and more right than he is wrong.

##Classics

I don't recommend reading the long tomes we call "classics" - their value-added is low relative to modern treatments. Nevertheless, if you want to look smart at parties, you can (claim to have) read:

1. Smith, *Wealth of Nations*
2. Keynes, *General Theory*
3. Schumpeter, *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy*
