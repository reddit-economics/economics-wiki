/u/Integralds's advice for grad students

----

## The Big Picture

You want to go on the job market in year 5 or year 6. To go on the job market, you need:

* A sole-authored job market paper
* An excellent letter of recommendation from your primary advisor
* (Recommended) A good paper that is R&R at a good journal (top 10, top field) that is coauthored with your advisor

That's it! All you need is that one damn paper.

The rest of this guide proceeds by backwards induction. The basic advice is: look at the CV packets coming out of Harvard, Stanford, Chicago, Penn, Minnesota, UCSD, etc, and figure out how to make *your* CV look like *that* in five years.

## The First Year

The first year *begins* with math camp and *ends* with first-year comps.

Recommended reading: [Matt Pearson's guide.](http://law.vanderbilt.edu/phd/How_to_Survive_1st_Year.pdf) Matt went to UT-Knoxville for his BA, UC-Davis for his PhD, and now works in the private sector.

* First year consists of coursework in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics. 
* At the end of first year, you will take prelims (aka comps, aka quals, aka hell-tests). Usually you get two tries to pass. If you don't pass, you are asked to leave.
* Therefore you have one goal in the first year: pass comps/quals/prelims in May.
* Everything is secondary to that goal.
* Form a study group as early as January. Or November.
* Your school will have copies of old comps floating around. Make a copy of the past comp packet and study from it.

----

## The Second Year

The second year begins when you've passed first-year comps and ends with field comps.

* The second year is devoted to coursework in your substantive fields of interest.
* Typically there are field comps after the second year.
* Unlike the first year, the primary goal of second year is *not* to pass field comps. That will happen naturally.
* The primary goal of second year is to write as many 15-page term papers as you possibly can.
* Corollary: use your courses as an excuse to write term papers.
* Corollary: take courses that have a term paper component.
* A good term paper will have a question, a model, and some preliminary results (theorems, regressions, impulse responses, etc).
* Numerical advice: I wrote 9 term papers during my second year. Most of them sucked, but three were worth pursuing.
* Okay, field comps are actually sort of important. Most require a deep knowledge of your subfield. Use this time to read deeply. You know my thirty-page macro reading list? I compiled that when preparing for my monetary field comp.

## First-year and Second-year summers

* Schools vary widely in the degree of summer support and expectations for summer work.
* Try to get one funded RAship during these two summers, preferably two, and preferably with your advisor.
* Work closely with your advisor during the RAship to produce a paper.
* The goal of a summer RAship is to produce a draft of a paper. You may start as a research assistant. You want to move to co-author as soon as possible.

## Third Year

"If you don't have a paper started by spring of the third year, *be alarmed.*" -- David Romer

* The third year is the hardest intellectually. Many people flounder at this stage.
* On or around September 1st of the third year, print out all of the papers you wrote during your second year and any papers you wrote during your summer RAships.
* You should have a packet of eight to twelve 15-page papers.  Lay them down on your desk. Four of them will suck and three will be nothing more than glorified lit reviews. Identify three that you think are worth pursuing.
* Bring those three papers to your advisor and, together, identify a single paper that you will pursue to completion during the third year.
* The goal of the third year is to produce a serious paper, potentially co-authored with your advisor. For brevity, I will call this your *third-year paper.*
* Your goal is to present this paper internally in the spring of the third year, then potentially at conferences during the summer.
* Many schools have a third-year paper requirement. Take that requirement seriously.

By writing many term papers in the second year, you begin the third year with a solid foundation. By beginning the third year with a solid foundation, you are less likely to fall through the cracks and waste a year.

They call it "third-year vacation" for a reason. Don't take a third-year vacation.

In February, sit down and prepare a preliminary dossier. This should include:

* Your CV
* Your third-year paper
* A brief (1-2 page) research statement

With those documents in hand, you may begin applying to summer research assistantships at central banks and other institutions.

## The Fourth Year

"If you don't have a paper largely finished by the fall of fourth year, ***panic.***" -- David Romer

* Present your third-year paper at conferences.
* Submit your third-year paper to good journals, with your advisor's approval.
* Begin writing your job-market paper no later than November of the fourth year.
* Your JMP could grow out of a second-year term paper or grow out of your third-year paper. Or it could be entirely new.
* Present your JMP internally in the spring.
* A fabulous goal is to have a solid draft of the JMP ready by April. That way you can spend the summer presenting, not writing.
* More realistically, you'll finish your JMP around July or even August.

## Third-year and Fourth-year summer

* Most central banks will *only* take dissertation-stage students as dissertation interns. That means you have to pass first-year comps and field comps first. 
* You should secure at least one internship outside of your home university during these two summers, preferably two.
* These internships can lead to conditional offers before the market even starts, which is quite useful.

## The Fifth Year

Recommended reading: [Cawley.](https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/pdfs/Job%20Market%20Guide%20and%20Advice%20--%202014-15%209-3-14.pdf)

* Prepare your dossier. This will include your CV, your 2-4 page research statement, your 1-2 page teaching statement, your JMP, your third-year paper, and any other projects you've worked on that are of acceptable quality.
* Set up your academic website.
* Make the go/no-go decision by October 15.
* Job market advice abounds, so I won't waste your time rehashing it. Briefly: apply to 150 jobs, interview at AEA, then go on flyouts, then receive offers, then negotiate and accept the best one.

Good luck!
